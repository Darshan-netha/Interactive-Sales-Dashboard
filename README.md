## Project Overview
This project is part of Week 6: Data Visualization Mastery with Seaborn under the Developers Arena Data Science Internship.
The aim of this project is to create a professional sales dashboard using Python, focusing on advanced data visualization and storytelling with data.

The dashboard analyzes sales data to understand product performance, regional trends, and sales distribution. Using Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly, multiple visualizations are combined into a single analytical view, enabling both static and interactive exploration of the data.

---

## Project Objective
The main objectives of this project are:

- To visualize sales data using advanced Seaborn plots
- To analyze sales distribution by product and region
- To identify patterns and relationships using correlation analysis
- To create a multi-plot dashboard layout
- To build an interactive visualization using Plotly
- To present insights in a clear and professional manner

---

## Dataset Used
The dataset contains transactional sales information used for analysis and visualization.

Columns:

- Date – Date of the sales transaction
- Product – Name of the product sold
- Price – Price per unit
- Customer_ID – Unique identifier for each customer
- Region – Sales region
- Total_Sales – Total sales amount for the transaction

Purpose:
This dataset is used to analyze sales distribution, compare product and regional performance, identify trends, and generate both static and interactive visualizations for the dashboard.

## Technologies / Tools Used
The following tools and libraries were used to build the interactive sales dashboard:

- Python 3 – Core programming language used for data analysis and visualization
- pandas – Used for loading, cleaning, and preparing the sales dataset
- Seaborn – Used to create advanced statistical visualizations such as box plots, violin plots, and heatmaps
- Matplotlib – Used for figure control, subplot layout, and saving visualizations
- Plotly – Used to build interactive charts with hover, zoom, and filtering capabilities
- Jupyter Notebook – Interactive environment used to develop, run, and present the dashboard

## Key Insights

- Sales distribution varies significantly across different products, with some products showing higher variability and outliers in sales values.
- Regional analysis reveals differences in sales performance, indicating that certain regions contribute more consistently to overall revenue.
- Correlation analysis helps identify relationships between numerical variables such as price and total sales.
- The combined dashboard view allows quick comparison of product-wise and region-wise sales performance.
- Interactive visualizations enable deeper exploration of the data, helping users identify patterns and trends more effectively.
